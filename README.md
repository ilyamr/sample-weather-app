This challenge is about building a small interface that shows the weather for the next 3 days. As a user I would want to be able to use it to get the following information.

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```
### Run

```bash
npm run start
```

### Requirements
1. In the morning I want to check the weather for today to make sure that I can dress accordingly.
2. Sometimes, when I leave home for the weekend, I want to make sure that it's not too windy, as I have sensitive plants on my balcony that I would have to move into my flat otherwise.
3. I also want to be able to set whether I need rain or not. My plants should stay hydrated.
4. I am usually checking the weather on my phone, so it should be responsive.

### Goal
Come up with a nice interface that addresses the user's needs. 

### Rules
- Use React as the surrounding framework. You may clone this repository or create your own.
- You are allowed to import other libraries for the interface such as MaterialUI, AntDesign, styled-components ...
- Please do not spend more than 3-4 hours for this challenge
